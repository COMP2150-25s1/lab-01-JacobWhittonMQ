-


Were you able to find your way through the level?
-


Did the jumps on the thin platforms successfully elevate the tension?
-


Did you find any parts of the level that seemed out of place, or otherwise needing improvement?
-



Were you able to adapt to the sections you found difficult after a few attempts?
-


If you reached the end, or otherwise finished a hard segment, how did it feel?
-
